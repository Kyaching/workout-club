          Ans: React is a Javascript library. React mainly focused on the User
          Interface of a website.React doesn’t have many moving parts for us to
          learn about and understand. Reactjs is simple. The advantage to having
          a small API to work with is that you can spend more time familiarizing
          yourself with it, experimenting with it, and so on. The syntax used by
          React components is called JSX (JavaScript XML). The idea is actually
          quite simple. A component renders content by returning some JSX. The
          JSX itself is usually HTML markup, mixed with custom tags for the
          React components. What’s absolutely groundbreaking here is that we
          don’t have to perform little micro-operations to change the content of
          a component.
